# Challenges
A repository of all my code research and solutions to challenges. There are some experimental REPLs, some CodeWars solutions, a few LeetCode problems and a whole lotta comments.

## Codewars

I'd love to hear from you if you have suggestions for improvement or thoughts about these problems, especially if they have a performance benefit!
